2025-12-25 20:50:29,395 [INFO] High stress detected with 51.8% confidence.
Key EEG indicators: significant alpha band suppression indicating reduced relaxation; elevated beta band power suggesting heightened arousal; right frontal dominance associated with withdrawal motivation.

Supporting evidence from scientific literature:
- Alpha Band Suppression in Stress: "Alpha band (8-13 Hz) power suppression is a well-established neural marker of stress and cognitive load. During stress, alpha desynchronization occurs particularly in frontal and parietal regions, ref..." (Source: Klimesch, 1999; Ray & Cole, 1985)
- Beta Band Elevation and Arousal: "Elevated beta band (13-30 Hz) activity is associated with heightened arousal, vigilance, and active cognitive processing. Stress-induced increases in beta power reflect activation of the sympathetic n..." (Source: Ray & Cole, 1985; Harmony, 2009)
- Frontal Theta and Cognitive Load: "Increased frontal midline theta (4-8 Hz) activity is observed during high cognitive load and anxiety states. This pattern reflects working memory engagement and emotional processing in the anterior ci..." (Source: Harmony et al., 2009; Sauseng et al., 2007)
